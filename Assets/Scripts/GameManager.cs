    - [x]  how many bugs and what kind (Color bugs for now)
    - [x]  what level played
    - [x]  display player stats and the amount they are increasing for next round
- [x]  Give instructions to player manager to upgrade player stats
- [x]  Handle game reset with level change in mind
    - [x]  level change would look like GM giving the instruction to SceneManager to change to "x" level
